## 💡 Project Idea
[A clear, concise 2-3 sentence description of your project's purpose and value proposition]
Back2You is a lost-and-found platform that helps users report and reclaim lost items efficiently. By leveraging intelligent matching algorithms, it privately connects finders and owners without publicly displaying item details, ensuring privacy and security. This system minimizes misuse while increasing the chances of reuniting users with their belongings.

## ✨ Key Features
- 🔍 Feature 1: Smart Matching System: Automatically detects lost and found item matches using AI-powered analysis.
- ⚡ Feature 2: Privacy-Focused Reports: Ensures item details are not publicly visible, preventing misuse while maintaining security.
- 🛡️ Feature 3: Seamless Notifications: Instantly alerts users via email when a potential match is found, streamlining the recovery process.
